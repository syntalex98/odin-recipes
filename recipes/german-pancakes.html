    <h3>German pancakes, golden-pan style</h3>
    <p>German pancakes are a childhood favorite of mine. Golden pan-style egg dish, with lots of big bubbles while baking. We eat these every Sunday morning. Serve with maple syrup.</p>
    <p>A German pancake (a.k.a. a Dutch baby) is similar to a large Yorkshire pudding. Unlike other types of pancakes, German pancakes are baked in the oven instead of fried on the stove. They also donâ€™t contain leaving ingredients, such as baking powder or baking soda.</p>
